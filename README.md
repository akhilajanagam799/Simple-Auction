## Simple Auction System

ðŸ›’ Simple Auction System
This repository contains a decentralized auction platform built using Solidity smart contracts and a React frontend. The application allows users to create auctions, place bids, confirm receipt, initiate disputes, and resolve them on the Ethereum blockchain.
ðŸ’¡ This project was developed by Team Hashers as part of a collaborative academic project.

 ## Setup Instructions:

### Prerequisites
**Node.js**: Ensure Node.js (v14 or later) is installed. [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

**Truffle Suite**: A development framework for Ethereum. Install globally via 
`npm install -g truffle`

**Ganache**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development. Install via Ganache GUI or 
  `npm install -g ganache-cli`
  
Start Ganache with a custom configuration

`ganache --networkId 1337 --gasLimit 20000000 --defaultBalanceEther 1000 --port 8545 --chain.hardfork london --blockTime 2 --db ./ganache-data`


**MetaMask**: A browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Install from metamask.io.

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auction-dapp.git
cd auction-dapp


Install Dependencies:

For the smart contracts (Truffle project):cd contracts
npm install


For the frontend (React app):cd ../frontend
npm install




Configure MetaMask:

Connect MetaMask to the Ganache network (Localhost 8545).
Import Ganache accounts (use the private keys provided by Ganache).


Compile and Migrate Contracts:

In the contracts directory, compile and deploy the contracts:truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development --reset


Copy the generated ABIs to the frontend:cp build/contracts/AuctionFactory.json ../frontend/src/contracts/AuctionFactory.json
cp build/contracts/Auction.json ../frontend/src/contracts/Auction.json




Start the Application:

In the frontend directory, start the React app:npm start


Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.



Troubleshooting

Ensure Ganache is running before starting the app.
If MetaMask connection fails, verify the network ID (1337) and RPC URL (http://localhost:8545).
Check console logs for contract deployment or transaction errors.

Explanation of Key Functions and Design Choices
Smart Contracts

Auction Contract:

Constructor: Initializes the auction with a creator, item name, starting bid, and duration. Validates inputs to prevent invalid setups.
placeBid: Allows users to bid, refunding the previous bidder if applicable. Uses a minimum increment (0.1 ETH) to ensure competitive bidding. Protected by nonReentrant to prevent reentrancy attacks.
endAuction: Only the creator can end the auction after the deadline, setting a 7-day confirmation period. This ensures the seller has control over the auction's conclusion.
confirmReceipt: The highest bidder confirms item receipt, transferring funds to the seller. Restricted to the bidder and requires the auction to be ended.
initiateDispute: The bidder can initiate a dispute within the confirmation period if the item isnâ€™t received. This provides a safety net for buyers.
resolveDispute: Only the creator can resolve disputes, choosing to award funds to themselves or refund the bidder. The onlyCreator modifier ensures only the seller decides, reflecting a centralized dispute resolution design to simplify logic, though it could be enhanced with arbitration in the future.
Design Choice: The use of ReentrancyGuard and gas-aware .call for transfers prioritizes security. The ItemStatus enum and events (e.g., FundsReleased, DisputeInitiated) enable transparent state tracking.


AuctionFactory Contract:

createAuction: Deploys new Auction instances and stores their addresses. Open to all users, promoting accessibility.
getAllAuctions: Returns all auction addresses for frontend retrieval, supporting a dynamic auction list.
Design Choice: A simple factory pattern was chosen for ease of deployment and management. Future enhancements could include ownership restrictions or auction categorization.



Frontend (App.js)

connectWallet: Integrates with MetaMask to connect user accounts, storing the address locally for session persistence.
fetchAuctionData: Polls the blockchain every 5 seconds to update the auction list, ensuring real-time data with retry logic for reliability.
handleResolveDispute: Calls the resolveDispute function on the contract. Currently lacks creator validation, causing reverts when called by the bidder (e.g., transaction from 0xc18c6e3a01efae45e8e838a22b0503850e731a29 with status: false and gasUsed: 37249). This should be fixed by adding a check against auctionCreator.
Design Choice: The React app uses Web3.js for blockchain interaction and local storage for offline data. Event listeners (e.g., AuctionCreated, NewHighestBid) provide real-time updates, while notifications enhance user experience. The current dispute resolution flow assumes UI restriction, which needs alignment with the contract's onlyCreator modifier.

Key Design Choices

Security: ReentrancyGuard and gas-aware transfers mitigate common vulnerabilities. However, the lack of a withdrawal mechanism for stuck funds is a potential risk.
User Experience: Real-time updates via events and a 1-second timer for auction countdowns improve interactivity, though polling could be optimized with WebSocket subscriptions.
Dispute Resolution: Centralized to the creator for simplicity, but this could be a limitation. A decentralized arbitration system could be explored for fairness.
Scalability: The bidHistory array in the Auction contract may grow large, increasing gas costs. An off-chain solution or history pruning could be considered.

Future Improvements

Add creator validation in handleResolveDispute to match the onlyCreator modifier.
Implement a withdrawal function for stuck funds in the Auction contract.
Enhance the Auctionfactory with filtering or pausing capabilities.
Optimize gas usage by limiting bidHistory or moving it off-chain.
